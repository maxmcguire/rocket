Rocket

Rocket is an alternative implementation of the Lua language. The core of the parser
and the VM are written from scratch, although they draw a lot of inspiration from
the Lua implementation. The implementation of the standard libraries is taken
directly from Lua.

It is currently in development and is not complete. See the TODO section for a list
of features that are still being worked on.

Differences from Lua 5.1:

  Language:
  - Support for C++ style single line and block comments
  - break does not have to be the last statement in a block
  - More strict handling of invalid escape sequences in a string
  - Includes bit library

  API:
  - Added lua_setgchook function
  - Added lua_pushtypename function
  - IO library can be registered with callbacks for custom file system access
  
Building
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rocket uses premake4 (requires at least version 4.4) to generate build files.
premake4 is available from http://industriousone.com/premake.

TODO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Weak tables
- __gc metamethod
- Garbage collector controls
- Coroutines
- Constant folding for logic operations and conditionals
- Debug functions
- Array optimization for tables
